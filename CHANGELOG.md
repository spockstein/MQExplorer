### üöÄ Major Features Added

#### Known Queues Configuration
- **New Feature**: Pre-configure queue names in IBM MQ connection profiles
- **UI Enhancement**: Added "Known Queues" section to connection profile form with validation
- **Bulk Import**: Support for comma-separated and multi-line queue name input
- **Validation**: Real-time queue name validation with IBM MQ naming rules
- **Fallback Strategy**: Use known queues when dynamic discovery fails due to authorization

#### Optimized Queue Discovery Performance
- **Performance Improvement**: Queue discovery now prioritizes known queues over dynamic PCF discovery
- **Faster Connections**: Significant reduction in connection time when known queues are configured
- **Smart Fallback**: Only attempts dynamic discovery when no known queues are available
- **Authorization Aware**: Graceful handling of MQRC_NOT_AUTHORIZED errors

#### Fixed IBM MQ Message Delete Functionality
- **Reliability Fix**: Complete rewrite of message delete operations for better reliability
- **Position-Based Deletion**: Improved message targeting using position-based approach
- **Multiple Message Delete**: Enhanced bulk deletion with better error handling
- **Progress Tracking**: Clear feedback on deletion progress and results
- **Error Recovery**: Continues processing even if individual deletions fail

#### Automatic Message List Refresh
- **Real-time Updates**: Message browser automatically refreshes after put/delete/clear operations
- **Visual Feedback**: Loading indicators show refresh progress
- **State Preservation**: Maintains current page and filter settings during refresh
- **Event-Driven**: Uses event system for efficient UI synchronization

#### Real IBM MQ Message Timestamps
- **Timestamp Accuracy**: Display actual message timestamps from MQMD instead of browse time
- **MQMD Extraction**: Extract PutDate and PutTime from IBM MQ Message Descriptor
- **Timezone Handling**: Proper conversion of IBM MQ timestamp format to JavaScript Date
- **Millisecond Precision**: Includes tenths and hundredths from MQMD for precise timing
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintains compatibility with other messaging providers

### üîß Technical Improvements

#### Enhanced Error Handling
- **Better Diagnostics**: Improved error messages and logging throughout the application
- **Graceful Degradation**: Better handling of authorization and network issues
- **User Feedback**: Clear error messages and recovery suggestions

#### UI/UX Enhancements
- **Refresh Indicators**: Visual feedback during message list refresh operations
- **Queue Source Indicators**: Clear labeling of dynamically discovered vs cached queues
- **Validation Feedback**: Real-time validation with helpful error messages
- **Performance Indicators**: Visual cues for optimization features

#### Code Quality
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Added extensive test suites for all new features
- **Documentation**: Updated inline documentation and code comments
- **Type Safety**: Improved TypeScript type definitions and error handling

### üêõ Bug Fixes
- Fixed message deletion operations that were previously unreliable
- Resolved queue discovery timeouts for users without admin privileges
- Fixed timestamp display showing browse time instead of actual message time
- Improved connection stability and error recovery

### üìö Documentation Updates
- Updated README.md with new features and configuration options
- Added comprehensive CHANGELOG.md entries
- Enhanced inline code documentation
- Updated package.json metadata

### ‚ö° Performance Improvements
